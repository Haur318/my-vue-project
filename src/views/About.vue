      <strong class="text-4xl">Who We Are</strong><br />
      Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that.
      <strong class="underline decoration-amber-500">MealsApp</strong> is a community built by and
      for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but
      love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping
      9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert.
      The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end
      of the night. Most importantly,
      <strong class="underline decoration-amber-500">MealsApp</strong> connects home cooks with
      their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital
      food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected.
      Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.
